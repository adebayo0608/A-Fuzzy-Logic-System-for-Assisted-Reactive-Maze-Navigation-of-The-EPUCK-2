OA_Control

OA_Control is a Python library designed specifically for obstacle avoidance in the ePuck 2 robotic platform. It provides a set of functions to enable obstacle avoidance in the ePuck 2.

OA_Execution
OA_Execution is the main script that executes the obstacle avoidance program on the ePuck 2 platform. It causes the interaction between the robot's sensors, the OA_Control library, and the ePuck 2 robotic system.

Features
- Provides functions for obstacle detection using sensor data from the ePuck 2.
- Implements algorithms for path planning and navigation around obstacles, optimized for the   ePuck 2 platform.
- Offers customizable parameters to change the maximum linear and angular velocity.
