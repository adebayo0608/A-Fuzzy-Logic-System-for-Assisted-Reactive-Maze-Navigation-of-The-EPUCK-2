# ü§ñ Welcome to the Project! 

This project aims to develop a robust system for human-controlled mobile-wheeled robots to navigate unknown obstacle-filled environments. 
To navigate an obstacle-filled environment, obstacle avoidance is critical to ensure safety.
The project uses the E-Puck 2 robot, a PS4 controller and a wooden maze with wooden obstacles.

## Approach üß†

The approach to obstacle avoidance involves sensor-based obstacle detection, followed by data collection on obstacle distance and position. A fuzzy logic controller then determines the optimal trajectory for obstacle evasion.

## Collaboration ü§ù

A Mealy finite state machine continuously transitions between autonomous and user control, depending on obstacle presence. To enhance the user experience during autonomous control, the E-Puck 2's LEDs are purple, and the controller vibrates.

## OA_Control üéõÔ∏è

**OA_Control** is a Python library designed for obstacle avoidance in the ePuck 2 robotic platform. It provides a comprehensive set of functions to enable obstacle avoidance in the E-Puck 2.

## OA_Execution üöÄ

**OA_Execution** is the main script executing the obstacle avoidance program on the ePuck 2 platform. It facilitates the interaction between the robot's sensors, the OA_Control library, and the E-Puck 2 robotic system.
